# Deep_Learning_with_PyTorch
This is my self-study note for the book "Deep Learning with PyTorch" (published in July 2020).

Hope this repository can assist in developing a comprehensive understanding of how PyTorch is utilized in deep learning.


The code for the book is available for download from Manningâ€™s website (www.manning.com/books/ deep-learning-with-pytorch) and on GitHub (https://github.com/deep-learning-with-pytorch/dlwpt-code). 

The 2nd edition was estimated to be published in Fall 2024.
