1. In the early 21st century, particularly around 2010, deep learning began to be widely applied and developed, 
  accompanied by an increase in computational power and the emergence of big data.

2. Deep Learning's initial appearance was in Computer Vision.

3. The first PyTorch was released on Jan 18, 2017.

4. Hardware and software requirements: 
   Require a CUDA-capable GPU. 
   Part 2 assumes:
        a GPU with 8 GB of RAM (suggest an NVIDIA GTX 1070 or better) 
        (parameters can be adjusted if your hardware has less RAM available)
        The raw data needs about 60 GB to download 
        200 GB (at minimum) of free disk space on the system to train model
