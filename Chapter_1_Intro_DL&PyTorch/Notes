1. Intelligence is a concept that we often conflate with self-awareness. Self-awareness is not required to
carry out AI tasks. 

2. Unlike the label machine learning, which heavily relied on feature engineering, deep learning
deals with tasks automatically through refining models. (This is not to say that feature engineering has no place 
with deep learning) 

3. The core data structure in PyTorch is multidimensional arrays (tensors). PyTorch also provides an extensive 
library of operation on them (torch module).

4. Tensors and operations on them can be conducted on either CPU or GPU. Transitioning calculations from the CPU 
to the GPU is as straightforward as adding one or two extra function calls. (up to 50 times over CPU calculation)

5. Two core things provided in PyTorch:
(1) core data structure: Tensors
(2) the ability of tensors to track the operations performed on them 

6. Two things offers in PyTorch make it particularly relevant to deep learning:
(1) Accelerated computation using GPU
(2) Numerical Optimization on generic mathematical expressions
